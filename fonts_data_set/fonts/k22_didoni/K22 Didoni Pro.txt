Pro Version of K22 Didoni

I combined K22 Didoni and K22 Didoni Swash into a single Open Type font. 
The font was not redrawn, only merged. The characters in the swash font, 
including those that were in the Private Use Area, are now available as 
OpenType feature. 

This font is only available to those who will make a donation for K22 Didoni. 
The font will only be sent to the email address that made the donation. You 
can make the donation by clicking on the donate button at

I also created another "pro" version of the font with a complete Latin 1 
character set. This version has a total of 307 glyphs. However, this version
is only available at my discretion.
