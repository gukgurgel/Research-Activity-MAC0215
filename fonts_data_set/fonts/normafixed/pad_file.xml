                         DISTRIBUTORS WELCOME

This document is placed in every shareware evaluation package from Fontmenu.com.
 It outlines the few requirements needed to distribute such material. Match Software 
shareware evaluation packages are intellectual property of Match Software.
 Although these files are proposed for free evaluation purposes to the public, 
Match Software reserves all copyrights.  Derogation to these rules are only possible 
with prior permission of Match Software. Any infringement on Match Software
copyright will be subject to the strongest legal action.

Match Software is a member of the Association of Shareware Professionals 
(ASP). All good standing ASP distributor members are welcome to

packages, as long as they respect points 1 &amp; 2. Non ASP distributors must 
make sure they comply with the other points outlined in the following 
text.

1 - Archives as prepared by Match Software must not be modified in any
way prior to distribution. Their content must not be modified in any way,
would it be by suppression or addition of information.

2 - Under no circumstance any part of Match Software shareware evaluation
packages should be used as component of any other software product
without prior consent of Match Software.

3 - Good standing ASP approved vendors, and distributor members, can
immediately proceed to publish this package on CD, as well as diskettes.
Any CD publishing from non-ASP vendors must be approved by Match Software
prior to publishing.  Authorization can be obtained easily by e-mail or
letter. Match Software reserves the right to refuse authorization if the
publisher or it&apos;s representative does not provide adequate information
about the publishing project. We appreciate that publishers provide us
with a sample of the published CD package, as soon as it is available.

4 - On-line services, BBS, Internet sites and other electronic networks

long as they respect points 1 and 2.

5 - Magazines who decide to distribute Match Software shareware
evaluation packages as part of a promotional disk must follow the same rules
as other shareware distributors.

6 - Always use the latest version of the shareware packages, which you
can download from our web site, or our ftp site. If you cannot find a specific 
package, please ask for it by eMail. We will send it to you electronically as soon

Software prepares these shareware evaluation packages with great care, 
and updates them regularly, in order for the public to receive the best
service as possible. The latest version of our archives are currently
available on our Web site : http://www.fontmenu.com and anonymous

Shareware is meant for Match Software as a meaningful and sensible way of 
marketing it&apos;s products. In doing so, many benefit from the generous 
efforts of the company : distributors, some of whom without shareware 
would probably loose a good part of their business, as well as users, who 
enjoy the privilege to use and test at will quality software before
buying it. Nevertheless, we welcome any offer of new ways of
distribution, publication or otherwise profitable ventures. The main
ingredient of most software products being not plastic or paper, but
creativity, we are quite sure some of our new ideas may find in
industrious hands a fortunate destiny. Please contact us, if you think
Match Software creations can profit your business !

Users of the fonts placed on this disk or in this archive must accept 
this disclaimer of warranty: &quot;These fonts are supplied as is.  
The author disclaims all warranties, expressed or implied, including, 
without limitation, the warranties of merchantability and of fitness 
for any purpose.

The author assumes no liability for damages, direct or conse-
quential, which may result from the use of these fonts.&quot;

If you feel like sharing your enthusiasm for our font products, 
please pass around our shareware evaluation packages, which you can

vendors, and on our web site : http://www.fontmenu.com. 
Please always make sure to pass along the complete archive.

Please, DO NOT POST TTF files by themselves. You would deprive
other users of a chance to get the full version of the font.

2 - SUPPORT

While we do our best to make sure you enjoy our fonts to their
fullest, please remember that they are both technical, and artistic
creations. We will gladly provide support for technical questions. 
Requests for artistic changes will be taken as suggestions, which 
implies one should not expect aesthetic touches as part of a normal 
support. Nevertheless, artistic point of views and suggestions are 
always welcome, and appreciated.

Before contacting us, please make sure you have read the end of this
document. It has been written, based on questions asked very
frequently, by users who requested support. Finding the answer in
this document will save you time and aggravation.

For practical and financial reasons, we cannot provide phone 
technical support. You may, however, report any problem at
(310) 388-5216. We will usually follow-up within 24 hours, 
by email or fax.

You can also contact us by email at support@fontmenu.com. 
Please try to be as specific as possible,in order to get appropriate
 help. Specify the name of the font you are using, on which
 platform (Mac, Windows or OS/2), and the exact nature of the
 problem. Depending on the complexity of the question, we will do 
our best to  reply as quicly as possible, usually within 24 hours.

Reported technical bugs will be fixed as rapidly as possible.
However, given the necessity for tests and verifications, it is
impossible to give standard time limit. In general, past experiences
have shown an average response in less than a week. When completed,
font updates will be sent to the customer who has reported the bug
by email (or regular mail, if no email is available).
Subscribers of our Free updates electronic newsletter will be notified 
immediately of new updates and new free packages available to download.
To subscribe, please visit http://www.fontmenu.com.

3 - LIMITED WARRANTY

If for any reason the registered version of the font/program was
provided to you directly by Match Software in a deffective archive, 
or on a defective media (disk or CD), it will be exchanged for a new 
one at no cost.

If you have suggestions for improving this font/program, we 
appreciate your comments. It does not mean we will fix or modify the
font in the way you wish in a given time, or that we must do it in
any way. However, if we feel the suggestion is appropriate, next
version of the font may be inspired from these advises.

We decline any responsibility if for any reason this font/program is
put to bad use in any way. It worked fine on a regular
configuration, and on a regular printer, with the most usual
software packages. If, for any reason, it could not work on your
specific configuration, Match Software cannot be held responsible. 
As technical combinations are almost infinite, and because systems 
evolve in ways we cannot predict, it might happen a new system, or a 
particular configuration, does not work with a font. For instance, 
because a new version of the system requires a new font format. In 
general, we will try to keep up with the system versions, and 
eventually offer upgrades, if possible, but it does not constitute
an obligation, nor would it be the case if you acquired a set of
seats cover for your specific car, and require they fit any new car
you may decide to buy later on.

4 - ASP OMBUDSMAN

Professionals (ASP).  ASP wants to make sure that the shareware
principle works for you. If you are unable to resolve a
shareware-related problem with an ASP member by contacting the
member directly, ASP may be able to help. The ASP Ombudsman can help
you resolve a dispute or problem with an ASP member, but does not
provide technical support for members&apos; products.
